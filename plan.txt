Plan the renovation:
- Measure the room.
- Make a list of ergonomic, aesthetic, and functional expectations.
- Contact an interior designer.
- Based on the designer’s suggestions, choose the preferred layout, furniture, and decorations for the room.

Gather supplies:
- Go over the chosen furniture and decorations and order each item online.
- Order paints, paint rollers, brushes, fillers, masking tape, and other necessities based on the scope of the renovation.

Prepare the room for the renovation:
- Empty out the room.
- Fill in nail holes and other damaged parts of the walls.

Paint the room:
- Lay out painting foil for floor protection and secure it in place.
- Paint the walls starting with corners and creases, moving to open spaces.
- Remove the painting foil.

Furnish and decorate the room:
- Find a helping hand — many pieces of furniture are impossible to assemble and/or move on your own.
- Place carpets on the floor.
- Put together pieces of furniture one by one and place them in their appropriate places.
- Add the decorations.
